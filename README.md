## Problem Description and Overview:
This programme is based on a real life task. Shopping from home is very feasible so many improvements are being made in this domain.
In coming future, drones would be used to deliver the goods to avoid human effort.  
*SUMMARY:*  
A drone is used to make deliveries to different destinations. The drone takes input from the user about the delivery destination then checks various conditions like *weather , weight of the delivery , battery charging and traffic*. The number of deliveries made and the time duration for each delivery is affected by the conditions.   
*HOW IT IS INTERESTING:*  
This programme is interesting in the sense that it allows us to create and use our own functions. The logic building of this programme requires a high level of creativity which challenges our logical and creative mindsets. Above all, this project taught us team coordination and collaboration, which was both enagaging and tough.
